    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <p>Fuel your wisdom like the Allfather himself with this hearty breakfast. Cook rolled oats with milk or water, then add chopped walnuts, dried cranberries, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Top it off with a sprinkle of chia seeds for added protein and omega-3s, representing Odin's ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who gather knowledge from the world.</p>
